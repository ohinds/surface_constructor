CVCNS Surface Constructor INSTALL Guide

The Surface Constructor (surfCon) is an application aiding in the
production of two-dimensional triangular mesh surface representations
of the boundary of three-dimensional objects. Input to surfCon is a
set of images of serial volume slices through an object. The images
are first mutually aligned if necessary, then points on the boundary
of the object are identified. The output of surfCon is a mesh
representation of the surface of the object. The Surface Constructor
is appropriate for use with partial surfaces, open surfaces, and
closed surfaces.


This INSTALL Guide describes how to install surfCon, and is
distributed along with surfCon.

(1) SOURCE INSTALLATION

The source distribution of surfCon requires compilation to create a
binary executable file. The process of compilation is slightly
different on different platforms, so platform specific instructions
are included below. Note that there are several libraries required on
all platforms to compile and run surfCon. These libraries are listed
below.


DEPENDENCIES

Listed below are the libraries required by surfCon. Platform specific
issues related to required libraries are described in the section for
each platform.

Required Libraries:
  o X11 (Windows and Linux)
  o OpenGL
  o GLUT
  o libxxf86vm-dev, libxmu-dev, and libxext-dev


OBTAINING THE SOURCE

Download a source archive from
https://github.com/ohinds/surface_constructor. Unpack the source to a
directory named 'surface_constructor'.

(A) LINUX


COMPILATION

The first step to compile the source for surfCon is to modify the
provided example makefile to be compatible with your system. On many
systems, this modification will be unnecessary since default locations
are specified in the example makefile.

So if you think your system is relatively standard, try compiling
surfCon with no modifications to the makefile by simply running the
following command in the directory surface_constructor.

	make

If the compilation process completes successfully, move on to the
section TESTING THE BINARY EXECUTABLE below.

If there was a problem in the compilation process, try editing the
makefile to account for possible differences in the locations of
libraries between the example makefile and your system.


TESTING THE BINARY EXECUTABLE

To quickly test if surfCon is working on your system, execute the
following command from the directory surface_constructor/demo:

	../bin/surfCon -f image_demo.ds

surfCon should load and display some traced images. Right click on the
window and choose 'quit' from the menu to exit surfCon. If that test
was successful, you have a compatible system.


ENVIRONMENT SETUP

Once the binary executable is working, the install process can be
completed by setting up your environment for surfCon. This is
accomplished by editing your shell config to add

export SURFACE_CONSTRUCTOR_HOME=<PATH_TO_THE SURFACE_CONSTRUTOR_ON_YOUR_SYSTEM>
export PATH=$PATH:$SURFACE_CONSTRUCTOR_HOME/bin

This assumes bash or zsh, if you are running tcsh your config will be
slightly different.


(B) MACINTOSH

UNPACKING THE ARCHIVE

The file named surfCon-src-mac-VERSION.tgz contains the source
distribution of surfCon for the Macintosh operating
system. Unpack this archive by opening a terminal
(Applications/Utilities/Terminal) and executing the following command:

	tar -zxvf surfCon-src-mac-VERSION.tgz

This will create a directory called surfCon-src-mac-VERSION that
contains the source code, a 'demo' directory, an AUTHORS file, a
COPYING file, a README and this INSTALL file.

INSTALLING FINK

Fink (fink.sourceforge.net) provides a GNU/Linux-like environment on
the macintosh. Download it and follow the installation
instructions.

COMPILATION

Run the following command in the directory surfCon-src-mac-VERSION:

	make OS=mac

If the compilation process failed, send an email detailing the problem
and the specific setup you are using to <oph@cns.bu.edu>.

brew install libjpeg
brew install gsl
Replace vecLib with Accelerate

Make getFaceArea not inlined.

TESTING THE BINARY EXECUTABLE

Before moving the executable file to a permanent home, it is a good
idea to test that it works on your system. To run a quick test,
execute the following command from terminal in the directory
surfCon-src-mac-VERSION:

	./surfCon -f demo/image_demo.ds


surfCon should load some images, then present you with a blank
screen. Right click on the window and choose 'quit' from the menu to
exit surfCon. If that test was successful, you have a
compatible system and can proceed to the section titled COPYING THE
BINARY EXECUTABLE. If this test failed for any reason, consult the
following section.


COPYING THE BINARY EXECUTABLE

Once the binary executable is working, the install process is
completed by copying the executable file named 'surfCon' to a
location in your executable path. Also, the the README file and demo
folder should be saved such that reference can be made to them
later.

On Macintosh '$HOME/bin' is a good place to copy the executable
to. You will to create this directory if it does not already exist. It
does no harm to create an existing directory, so create the directory
and and copy the executable by executing the following commands:

	mkdir $HOME/bin
	cp -a surfCon $HOME/bin

Next, the location '$HOME/bin' must be added to your executable
path. To do this, use a text editor such as emacs to edit the file
'.bashrc' in your home directory. Open the file by running the
command:

	emacs $HOME/.bashrc

Next, add the following line at the end of the file:

	PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin


surfCon should then be runnable by executing the command

	surfCon [OPTIONS]


Consult the README distributed with the archive for a tutorial on the
usage of surfCon.
