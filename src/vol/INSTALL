CVCNS Volume Processing Library (libvp) INSTALL

Last Updated: $Date: 2006/09/28 23:41:58 $
Latest Version: 0.15

The Volume Processing Library (libvp) provides a set of routines for
reading, writing, and manipulating image volumes gathered from MRI,
PET, CT, serial section data, etc.

This INSTALL describes how to install the libvp, with which it is
distributed.


__________________________________________________________________________


The Volume Processing Library is a set of c functions designed
to be compiled into a shared library. This library has been tested
as part of c and c++ applications.

System and Dependencies

The Volume Processing Library has been tested on Linux, mac and
windows. On mac the fink environment (http://fink.sourceforge.net) is
required. On windows the cygwin environment (http://cygwin.com) is
required.

Installation

The makefile in the root directory of the distribution should do most
of the installation work required. Edit the makefile to change any
parameters specific to your system such as the install
path. To build the library, type
$ make OS=<os>
where <os> is either linux, win, or mac
on cygwin and mac you probably have to create /usr/local/include:
$ mkdir /usr/local/include/
then:
$ sudo make install

This will copy and link the binaries, as well as install the header
files.
