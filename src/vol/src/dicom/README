(X)MedCon's DICOM library
-------------------------

This library code was originally contributed by 'Tony Voet'.

Additional changes were made for use within the (X)MedCon project.

Original version: libdicom 0.31 (1998)
Adapted  version: 13-Oct-2002

 - without jpeg-6a lib dependency
 - use GNU's automake/autoconf/libtool (= libtools convenience library)
 - prevent rescaling of pixel values
 - using define MEDCON_INTEGRATED for a splitted library which: 
      - enables  to set file stream from outside the lib
      - disables closing of the file stream 
 - changes to use original OFFIS DCMTK dicom.dic dictionary
 - read GE implicit little endian except big endian pixels
 - modular dictionaries, built during compilation process
 - support for color through color reduction with external function
 - unpacking of 12 bits allocated pixels 
 - encapsulated pixeldata: rle, lossless jpeg

Usage:
-----

This directory needs to be configured from within the (X)MedCon distribution 
which will create the proper "Makefile". Building the library requires another
two dictionary files:

        - dictionary.SQ
        - dictionary.data 

Both are extracted from the source dictionary file "dicom.dic". The latter can
be a mixture of the standard dicom dictionary "dict-dicom.dic" and any other
user specified dictionaries. See also "DICTXTR" variable in the "Makefile".
Any changes in the dictionaries requires the rebuilt of the above two files.
This can also be done manually:

     $> make rmdicts   (to remove both dictionary files)

     $> make dodicts   (to make   both dictionary files) 

Support on encapsulated LossLess JPEG pixeldata provided in 'ljpg' subdir.
